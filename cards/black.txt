armed with a dubstep gun
armed with a gatling gun
armed with a lightsaber that has two smaller lightsabers sticking out of the hilt
armed with a machete
armed with a piranha launcher
armed with a railgun
armed with a really really bright laser pointer
armed with a surface-to-air missile launcher
bitten by a radioactive _
can call orbital bombardments
can flyâ€¦ at the speed of molasses
can leap over tall buildings in a single bound
can only be killed by a shot to the head
can only be killed by a stake through the heart
can summon infinite trampolines
cannons instead of hands
chained to their evil twin
commands an army of disposable minions
covered in gasoline
everything they touch turns inside out
flaming hands
has an enormous exposed brain
has an enormous exposed brain
in a flying saucer
is faster than a speeding bullet
is really good at parkour
is really really emotional
leading a team of trained velociraptors
literally a GIF
machine guns for legs
regrows body parts at will
riding a nuclear missile
shoots lasers out of ears
stuck in one of those electric cars for toddlers
swinging a two-ton tuna
throws water balloons filled with acid
using _ as a club
wearing a bubble wrap suit
wearing a scuba suit
wrapped in toilet paper
